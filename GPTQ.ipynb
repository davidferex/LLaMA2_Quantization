    "# Creation of a quantization, use and evaluation pipeline, featuring LLaMA2 7B model and GPTQ\n",

    "In this project, we evaluate the impact quantization has in a common use LLM model, in our case LLaMA 2 7B, evaluating it in a sentiment analysis task. Our pipeline is defined as follows:\n",
    "- Add a classification layer at the end of the not-quantized model and train this layer with our dataset.\n",
    "- Quantize the model using **GPTQ** in three variants, 8bit, 4 bit and 3bit quantization.\n",
    "- Compare the performance of our models (not quantized, 4bits 8bits and 3 bits) in terms of precission, memory use, inference speed and emissions.\n",

    "We follow this approach because it is the easiest approach to follow. Another option would be to firstly quantize the base model and then add the classification layer and train it.

    "## GPTQ\n",
    "\n",
    "GPTQ (Gradient Post-Training Quantization) is an advanced quantization method designed specifically for fine-tuning and optimizing large language models. It was developed to address the need for efficient deployment of these models without significant loss in accuracy. By applying quantization techniques at the post-training stage (therefore a PTQ method), GPTQ reduces the precision of model weights while preserving critical characteristics of the original model, making it ideal for scenarios where memory and computational resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind GPTQ is gradient-guided quantization, which uses gradient-based metrics to prioritize the importance of different weights in the model. Unlike naive quantization methods that treat all weights equally, GPTQ identifies weights that have the greatest impact on the model's performance and assigns them higher precision values. Typically, these critical weights are left at higher precision, such as 16-bit floats, while less influential weights are quantized to lower precision formats like 8-bit or 4-bit integers. This selective approach minimizes the quantization error and helps maintain model accuracy. These weights are identified using a second-order approximation based on the Hessian matrix. This approach allows the measurement of the model's sensitivity to changes in its weights, minimizing accuracy loss. First, the squared error introduced by quantizing each weight individually is computed. The metric used is: $\\|WX - \\hat{W}X\\|^2$, where W represents the original weights, $\\hat{W}$ are the quantized weights, and X corresponds to the layer inputs. Subsequently, an approximation of the Hessian matrix is calculated to estimate each weight's contribution to the overall error. Using this information, weights are ranked by their impact, and those with the highest influence on accuracy are processed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once identified, weights are processed through an iterative and adaptive approach that adjusts the remaining weights to compensate for the error introduced by quantization. This treatment involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Adaptive Quantization: Each weight is quantized to the desired precision level. Then, the remaining weights are dynamically updated to minimize the cumulative error caused by the quantization of the processed weight.\n",
    "2. Global Approach: Instead of separating weights into categories of high and low impact, GPTQ adopts a holistic strategy, optimizing all weight interactions within the same layer.\n",
    "3. Block-wise Processing: In large-scale models, weights are divided into blocks (e.g., column blocks). Each block is quantized independently to enhance computational efficiency, significantly reducing the cost of processing very large matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of GPTQ is its iterative approach to quantization. Instead of quantizing all weights at once, GPTQ applies quantization layer by layer, recalculating gradients at each step. This allows the method to adjust for quantization-induced errors dynamically and ensures that the final model remains robust. The process results in a model with a significantly smaller memory footprint while retaining most of its predictive performance. Layer-by-layer compression in GPTQ relies on an independent optimization strategy for each layer. This ensures that the impact of quantization on one layer does not propagate uncontrollably to the rest of the model. The procedure follows these steps:\n",
    "1. Input and Output of Each Layer: A small dataset is used to calculate the inputs (X) and outputs for each layer of the model. These inputs and outputs serve as a reference to assess the quantization impact.\n",
    "2. Local Optimization: For each layer, an optimization problem is solved to minimize the difference between the original output (with full-precision weights) and the output generated with quantized weights. This ensures each layer is locally adjusted to preserve the modelâ€™s overall accuracy.\n",
    "3. Sequential Processing: The model is quantized sequentially, layer by layer. The inputs to each layer are updated using the outputs from already quantized layers. This approach ensures efficient quantization while maintaining consistency across the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Inference with models quantized using GPTQ incorporates key features to optimize performance:\n",
    "1. Dynamic De-quantization: Weights stored in low precision (e.g., 3 or 4 bits) are dynamically converted to higher precision during runtime. This enables accurate computations without significantly increasing storage requirements.\n",
    "2. Optimized Kernels: Custom kernels are used to perform matrix-vector multiplications, where the matrix is quantized, and the vector remains in high precision. These kernels are designed to minimize memory movement, resulting in significant acceleration of inference time.\n",
    "3. Memory Reduction: Quantization significantly reduces the memory required to store model weights. For example, a 3-bit quantized GPT-175B model can be executed on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, compared to multiple GPUs required for the non-quantized version.\n",
    "4. Efficiency in Generative Tasks: In tasks like text generation, where the model processes one token at a time, this strategy improves inference speed by reducing the time needed to access and process weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, GPTQ combines the efficiency of lower precision computations with the precision of gradient-guided weight selection, allowing large models to operate in constrained environments without sacrificing accuracy. This makes it an essential tool for deploying modern large language models in real-world applications."

If we compare the 8bit model and the 4bit model, we obtain that the 4-bit model took 9.83% less time. Comparing with the 3 bit model, the 8-bit model took 39.75 less time and the 4-bit model 45.69% less.

    "These results are surprising because the normal thing to expect is the smaller quantized model to perform faster. However, this does not happen. Previously, with BitsAndBytes we thought this was due to the nature of the BitsAndBytes quantization algorithm. However, after seeing this happening again with GPTQ, we stopped and tried to figure out what was happening. We reached the conclusion that this happens because we are doing the inference in evaluation without batches, just one by one. As these two quantization methods convert back to fp16 for inference, this adds a significant overhead. This leads to a higher inference time if we do not take advantage of the lower bit rate and use higher batch sizes. Results obtained in this section for quantized models using batches during inference seem to prove this."

    "Results show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quantization does in fact reduce accuracy, and the lower the bit count, the higher this drop is. However, the drop with **GPTQ** is not as significant, as we saw. Accuracy remain close to the base model results. \n",
    "2. Quantized models are noticeably better in terms of memory usage compared to the base model. However, the use of batches can elevate memory needs considerably. \n",
    "3. Contrary to what would be expected, quantized models with **GPTQ** are not faster than the base model. This probably is due to the nature of this quantization method, that restores all the values to fp16 for inference, and as we do a \"one by one\" (not using batches) evaluation, this overhead makes the model work slower. However, more studies and experimentation is needed in this area. \n",
    "4. In a similar fashion as inference time, emissions are higher in the quantized models. This is coherent with the fact that the inference time is higher. However, the differences here are smaller compared to the differences when comparing speed, probably due to the size of the models.\n",
